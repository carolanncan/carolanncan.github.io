  <h1 class="page-title">About me</h1>
  <p class="page-intro">
    I live in San Francisco with my husband, George. I was born and raised in
    Oklahoma. I grew up loving Bob Dylan, diversity, and other things you might
    not expect from the midwest. I love design and I love people. I don't think
    you can do one without the other.

  <h6>What I've learned about design</h6>
  <h5>Design is a team sport.</h5>
  <p class="design-things-description">
    My role as a designer isn't to have all the answers but to combine my
    expertise with the that of everyone around me.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h5>Start by asking questions.</h5>
  <p class="design-things-description">
    Ask "why" as many times as you have to in order to get to the root of a
    problem or the true reason behind a decision.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h5>Communication is critical.</h5>
  <p class="design-things-description">
    Being able to explain the "why" behind a decision helps everyone around
    you contribute to the design process and work together toward the same
    goal.
