<h1>About Me</h1>

<!-- <h5 class="pow-ease wrap">This is going to be good:</h5> -->
<p class="wrap">I live in San Francisco with my husband, George. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I grew up loving Bob Dylan, <a href="http://www.npr.org/people/2100380/neal-conan">Neal Conan</a>, diversity, and other things you might not expect from the midwest. I love design because I love people; I don't think you can do one without the other.</p>
