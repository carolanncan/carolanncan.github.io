		<h3>Facilitating Research through Machine Learning</h3>
		<p>Playing off of the word "label", Laybull is an application that turns the "lay" person into a powerful tool for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

		I partenered with a developer who originated the idea for this app. We believe we have created an extremely efficient workflow for a very cumbersome task.</p>
		<!-- <p>I've been responsible for shaping the user workflow and experience and designing the interface and the logo. We are in the prototype stage and will be moving on to user-testing from here.</p> -->

			Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. The goal of machine learning is to be able to make predictions about pieces of data based on attributes a machine has learned from a defined set of data.

		<figcaption>Creating the interface for the labels (get it, Laybull?), menu was the big challenge. Generally, most projects have a simple tree of labels that only have one level of decendants (if that). We wanted to nurture projects that have a small or large amount of labels with varying levels of decendants.

		<figcaption><strong>One tap</strong> = apply label to selection. <strong>Swipe left</strong> = apply parent label to selection and view children of parent label to either apply to selection or simply tap outside of the menu to get back to your data.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>I've done a few initial sketches of possible logo options. We want to convey strength, power, and agility as these are the most important benefits of using the app for machine learning.
