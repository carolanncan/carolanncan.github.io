  <h1 class="project-title">Rebrand concept for the City of Cedar Hill</h1>
  <p class="project-intro">
    The city is often referred to as &ldquo;the hill country of Dallas&rdquo;.
    With large areas of tree cover, a state park with camping grounds, and
    access to a one of the largest lakes in the region for boating and fishing,
    its main focus for tourism is camping and outdoor activities.

    The city wanted to appeal to young people in their early twenties as well
    as families and young couples. A subdued color palette combined
    with overlapping geometric elements gives the concept a modern feel.

    The city advertises in the Dallas Lovefield airport, whose abbreviation is
    &ldquo;LUV&rdquo;. We wanted to play on the abbreviation in our banner for
    travelers.
