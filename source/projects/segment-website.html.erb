  <h5>Visitors to our website leave with no idea what we do.</h5>
  <p>
    The previous version of the Segment site suffered from lengthy copy that
    used technical jargon. The messaging was, at times, difficult for even our
    technical audience to understand. The site would often have several CTA's
    on the same page but no clear point of conversion for visitors. And
    overall, the visual design had grown to be a bit cluttered, weakening the
    message for the product and the brand.

  <h5>Simplifying the message.</h5>
  <p>
    My goal was to simplify the message and emphasize the right pieces to
    create a compelling home page.

  <h3>The process:</h3>
  <p>
    Review <a href="#">Jobs to Be Done research</a> for what motivates customers to
    use Segment and the vocabulary they use to talk about the jobs they use Segment
    for.

    With the feedback we received from testing our prototypes, we built a mockup of the home page.

    After flushing out some details in the mockup, I built the final version in HTML/CSS and pushed to production :shipit:

  <h6>Key takeaways from this project:</h6>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      Use vocabulary and language that your customers use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep the copy short and sweet. Visitors aren't likely to spend long reading
      the text on your site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Test comprehension of your graphics! Most of our early graphics were
      confusing and meaningless to people.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unless your product solves a well known problem (e.g. TurboTax for taxes),
      the way to make your product the most compelling is by contrasting the old
      way of doing things with the new way of doing things.
    </li>
    <li>
      A visitor doesn't need to understand everything about your product. They
      just need enough to understand and remember what your product is and how
      the could benefit from it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Background research:</h6>
  <p>
    In Nancy Duarte's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk">Tedx
      Talk</a> she describes her research into some of history's most compelling
    patterns of communication.

    This inspired us to the customer's life before Segment with the customer's life
    after Segment. You can see an example of that in this graphic:
