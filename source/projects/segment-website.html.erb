    The challenge for this project was to make Segment easier to understand
    through the marketing site. We redesigned the site to give visitors a more
    clear idea of what the product does and how it might help them.

  <div class="text-wrap">
    <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>
        <p>
          There wasn't a clear strategy for how we were marketing the product to
          the outside world and who the target audience should be.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Customer Success team and the Sales team were spending time
          answering questions in support tickets and product demos that should've
          been easily answered by our marketing site.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Communicating the value of Segment was getting derailed by technical
          jargon and a bit of graphic clutter.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div class="text-wrap">
    <h4>Understanding the problem</h4>
    <p>
      Referencing the <a href="#">Jobs to Be Done research</a> I performed a few
      months ahead of this project, I looked at the job our customers are hiring
      Segment to help them with.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-wrap">
    <p>
      The Jobs-to-be-done method helped me frame the messaging for the page. It
      was helpful to focus the message on exactly what a visitor to the site
      would want to know about the product:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li><p>Why someone would care about the product</p></li>
      <li><p>What job they hire the product to do</p></li>
      <li><p>How the product works to help you do that job</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h4>Background research:</h4>
    <p>
      In Nancy Duarte's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk">Tedx Talk</a>
      she describes her research into some of history's most compelling patterns of
      communication. This idea inspired us to structure our story around the
      customer's life before Segment compared to the potential of the customer's
      life after Segment.
    </p>

  <div class="work-image"><img src="/images/portfolio/segment-site/old-v-new-whiteboard.png"></div>

  <div class="text-wrap">
    <p>
      This idea influenced how we wrote the copy for the site and the
      illustrations we created. You can see an example of that method used in the
      graphic below, which we used on the final version of the site.
    </p>

    <h4>Diverging</h4>
    <p>
      I made use of brainmapping, rapid brainstorming, and sketching exercises to
      explore a wide range of possibilities for writing and illustrating the
      story of the job to be done.
    </p>

    <h4>Converging</h4>
    <p>
      With feedback from my team, I narrowed down the options that were the most
      compelling and fit with our brand. With the general direction of the story
      defined, I repeated the process of iteration with copy and illustrations.
    </p>

    <h4>Testing and prototyping</h4>
    <p>
      I set up interviews with a few acquaintances and friends that fit into our
      target audience but aren't too familiar with Segment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <img src="/images/portfolio/segment-site/prototypes.png" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ABA8A0; margin: 1em auto 2em">

  <div class="text-wrap">
    <p>
      In the interviews, I asked them to say their thoughts out loud while they
      were looking at the home page prototype. This helped me gauge the
      effectiveness of the copy, graphics, and overall structure of the message.
    </p>

  <div class="text-wrap">
    <h4>The end result</h4>
    <p>
      With the feedback we received from testing our prototypes, I built a mockup
      of the home page and built the final version in HTML/CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Success team has reported an overall decrease in support tickets asking
      general questions about the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sales team has helped contribute to and rally behind the value
      propositions we use to familiarize new customers with the product.

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <h6>A visitor doesn't need to understand everything about the product.</h6>
    <p>
      They
      just need enough to understand and remember what your product is and
      how the could benefit from it.
    </p>
    <h6>Keep the copy short and sweet.</h6>
    <p>
      Visitors aren't likely to spend long reading
      the text on your site.
    </p>
    <h6>Talk like your customers.</h6>
    <p>
      In your marketing copy, use vocabulary that your customers use. They'll
      easily understand and relate to your product.
    </p>
    <h6>Test the comprehension of your graphics!</h6>
    <p>
      Most of our early graphics
      were clever by our standards but confusing to people outside of the
      company.
    </p>
    <h6>Contrast the old way with the new way.</h6>
    <p>
      Contrasting the old way of doing things with the new way of doing
      things is a very quick and compelling way to communicate the value of
      something.
