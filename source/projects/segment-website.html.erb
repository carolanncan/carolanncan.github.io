    The challenge for this project was to make Segment easier to understand
    through the marketing site. We redesigned the site to give visitors a more
    clear idea of what the product does and how it might help them.

  <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>
        There wasn't a clear strategy for how we were marketing the product to
        the outside world and who the target audience should be.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The Customer Success team and the Sales team were spending time
        answering questions in support tickets and product demos that should've
        been easily answered by our marketing site.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Communicating the value of Segment was getting derailed by technical
        jargon and a bit of graphic clutter.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <h4>Simplifying the message.</h4> -->
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   I went on a trip to New York with some members of our Success team to get -->
  <!--   feedback from customers on the product and answer any questions they might -->
  <!--   have about their setup. In one of our meetings, a customer said: -->
  <!-- </p> -->
  <!--  -->
  <!-- <blockquote> -->
  <!--   <p> -->
  <!--     Getting buy&#45;in from my boss has been difficult because they don't really -->
  <!--     understand what Segment does. And I can't just send them a link to your -->
  <!--     website because the site is confusing and doesn't really explain what you -->
  <!--     do. -->
  <!--   </p> -->
  <!-- </blockquote> -->

  <h4>The process:</h4>
  <p>
    Referencing the <a href="#">Jobs to Be Done research</a> I performed a few
    months ahead of this project, I looked at the job our customers are hiring
    Segment to help them with.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jobs-to-be-done method helped me frame the messaging for the page. We
    get to the heart of why someone would care about the product, what job they
    hire the product to do, and how the product actually help you do that job.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-wrap">
  <p>
    I made use of brainmapping, rapid brainstorming, and sketching exercises to
    explore a wide range of possibilities for telling the story of the job to
    be done.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="text-wrap">
  <p>
    With feedback from my team, I narrowed down the options that were the most
    compelling and fit with our brand. With the general direction of the story
    defined, I repeated the process of iteration with copy and illustrations.

    With the feedback we received from testing our prototypes, we built a mockup of the home page.

  <h6>Background research:</h6>
  <p>
    In Nancy Duarte's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFpuc2Umk">Tedx
      Talk</a> she describes her research into some of history's most compelling
    patterns of communication.
  </p>

<div class="text-wrap">
  <p>
    This inspired us to the customer's life before Segment with the customer's life
    after Segment. You can see an example of that in this graphic:

  <h4>The end result</h4>
  <p>
    The Success team has reported an overall decrease in support tickets asking
    general questions about the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Sales team has helped contribute to and rally behind the value
    propositions we use to familiarize new customers with the product.

  <h4>Takeaways</h4>
  <h6>Talk like your customers.</h6>
  <p>
    In your marketing copy, use vocabulary that your customers use. They'll
    easily understand and relate to your product.
  </p>
  <h6>Keep the copy short and sweet.</h6>
  <p>
    Visitors aren't likely to spend long reading
    the text on your site.
  </p>
  <h6>Test the comprehension of your graphics!</h6>
  <p>
    Most of our early graphics
    were clever by our standards but confusing to people outside of the
    company.
  </p>
  <h6>Contrast the old way with the new way.</h6>
  <p>
    Contrasting the old way of doing things with the new way of doing
    things is a very quick and compelling way to communicate the value of
    something.
  </p>
  <h6>A visitor doesn't need to understand everything about the product.</h6>
  <p>
    They
    just need enough to understand and remember what your product is and
    how the could benefit from it.
  </p>
