    The objective for this project was to increase the activation rate of our
    customers. To do this, I needed to empathize with the user's objective to
    get Segment working on their app as quickly as possible without friction.

  <h4>Problems to solve for:</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>
        The existing setup flow was a single page without specific directions
        on what to do next. The user was presented with links to different
        areas in the app and all of the libraries that were built for the API,
        but no guidance on where to start digging in.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Many users were choosing the wrong library to implement because of how
        we were presenting the libraries available on our platform. So from the
        beginning, they were encountering bugs and didn't see any success with
        the product.

  <h4>Brainstorming possible workflows</h4>
  <p>
    The goal of the workflow is to help users quickly and accurately get
    Segment set up on their app. The secondary goal is to help the user
    experience success, even if they don't get Segment completely installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing we want is for the user to hit a roadblock, to feel that
    they've failed, or that they lack the technical knowledge to be successful
    with Segment.

    I started by outlining where the user begins and where they want to end up.
    From there, I brainstormed as many workflows as possible to make sure we
    found the solution that helped users get to a place where they could
    experience success with the product as soon as possible.

  <h4>The end result</h4>
  <p>
    We created a final workflow that guides a user through a complicated set up
    with small wins at the completion of each step.
