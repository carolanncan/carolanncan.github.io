        This project is Josh Guthrie's brainchild. Laybull is an application that turns
        the &ldquo;lay&rdquo; person into a powerful tool for machine learning and
        artificial intelligence.

      <p>
        Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. The goal of machine
        learning is to be able to make predictions about pieces of data based on
        attributes a machine has learned from a defined set of data.

      We spent about 2 months getting down the user needs and priorities before we
      began putting a workflow into wireframes.

    Creating the interface for the labels (get it, Laybull?), menu was the big
    challenge. Generally, most projects have a simple tree of labels that only have
    one level of decendants (if that). We wanted to nurture projects that have a
    small or large amount of labels with varying levels of decendants.

    <strong>One tap</strong> = apply label to selection. <strong>Swipe
      left</strong> = apply parent label to selection and view children of parent
    label to either apply to selection or simply tap outside of the menu to get
    back to your data.

      I've done a few initial sketches of possible logo options. We want to convey
      strength, power, and agility, since these are the most important benefits of
      using the app.
