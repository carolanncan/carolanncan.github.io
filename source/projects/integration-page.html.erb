<h3>The problem:</h3>

<h6>Failing to communicate helfpul information.</h6>
<p>
  Some integrations can receive data from Segment with our out-of-the-box
  implementation. But many tools need to be instrumented in a way that requires
  extra steps and instruction.
</p>
<p>
  We were failing to communicate required extra steps in the interface, which
  created a point of failure for our users. The lack of clarity around what
  extra steps are necessary and which integrations required the extra steps was
  creating a confusing and frustrating experience for customers.
</p>

<h6>Users can't troubelshoot on their own.</h6>
<p>
  Users could not troubleshoot independently which created frustration for them
  and a heavy work load for our support team.
</p>

<p>
  Looking into the future, we'll be adding even more integrations to the
  platform that will require a few extra steps of set up. With this in mind,
  the process needs to be really clear.
</p>


<h3>The existing workflow is confusing.</h3>
<p>
  There were a few qualities we wanted to retain in the interaction:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The feeling of something you just want to click on</li>
  <li>Sending data to an integration feels effortless.</li>
  <li>It’s an interface element that a lot of people are familiar with.</li>
</ul>

**Things that are not working well:**

- “Turning on” and “turning off” a tool is not the best mindset to put our
customers in when they’re making the decision to start or stop sending data to
an integration.  - We want Segment to become more of a marketplace for
customers and partners. With the toggle, the product feels a bit more like a
switchboard.  - The **tile **and the **toggle** are each clickable but have
two, slightly different outcomes, which creates some confusion.


**Why did we remove the toggle right now?**

- The integrations-platform team has been working on a project (+ Platform
Mobile and + Platform Integration Sheets Enhancements ) to make a few small
improvements to the experience of our mobile integrations.  - The integrations
page has a lot of known issues. In trying to work around those issues for the
current project, it became harder to justify keeping the toggle than to remove
it.


**What about all of our messaging about the toggle and the “flip of a
switch”?**

- This creates work for our marketing team and anyone involved in external
communication to update messaging about Segment.  - We think we can make a
graceful transition away from the toggle by making incremental updates.

A toggle is more commonly used for low-stakes decisions/actions. Here’s an
example from Spotify.


- These updates haven’t been tested on users yet. They are a quick band-aid for
some known or obvious issues. More thorough updates are coming next!
