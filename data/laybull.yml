    introduction: 'Playing off of the word &ldquo;label&rdquo;, Laybull is an
      application that turns the &ldquo;lay&rdquo; person into a powerful
      tool for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I partenered
      with a developer who originated the idea for this app. We think we have
      created an extremely efficient workflow for a very cumbersome task.
      <br /> Our next step is to begin user-testing on our prototype.'

      one: 'Creating the interface for the labels (get it, Laybull?), menu
        was the big challenge. Generally, most projects have a simple tree of
        labels that only have one level of decendants (if that). We wanted to
        nurture projects that have a small or large amount of labels with
        varying levels of decendants.'
      two: '<strong>One tap</strong> = apply label to selection.
        <strong>Swipe left</strong> = apply parent label to selection and
        view children of parent label to either apply to selection or simply
        tap outside of the menu to get back to your data.'
      three: 'Initial sketches of possible logo options. We want to convey
        strength, power, and agility, since these are the most important
        benefits of using the app.'
