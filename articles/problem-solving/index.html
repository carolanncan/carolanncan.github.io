      The inspiration for this outline came from working with the Google
      Ventures Design Sprint model and the Design Council's Double Diamond
      model. I wanted to take the opportunity to make an outline of each step
      of the problem-solving process from what I found valuable about both of
      those models as neither have been a perfect fit for my experiences.

      The process by which we define problems and the way in which we solve
      them has a significant impact on the form the solution takes. This is
      only an outline of the general process I use when solving design problems
      for a business. It doesn't describe the inherent messiness of solving a
      problem.

<div class="text-wrap">
  <h3>Understand</h3>
  <p>
    To correctly define a problem, you need a complete picture of what is
    creating the problem. This is why it's important to understand the
    circumstances and forces surrounding a situation <em>before</em> trying to
    define a problem and arrive at a solution.

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Define</h3>
  <p>
    Every decision made from this point on will be working to resolve the
    problem statement. So it's important to make sure the problem statement
    continues to reflect the root problem to be solved. Otherwise, we might
    define the problem too narrowly or design solutions for adjacent problems
    without ever fixing the causal problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the rest of the process, more will be learned which will shed
    new light on underlying problems. Revisit this stage and iterate on the
    problem statement if the project needs re-calibration.

        Identify the project objectives.

    <li>
      <p>
        Define the scope of the problem.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How do we reach our goals?</h4>
  <ol class="numbered-list">
    <li>
      <p>
        Analyze the information from the Understand phase.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Synthesize the information to create a list of the issues that need to
        be addressed.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Create a single problem statement that defines the objective for this
        project.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Explore</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this stage is to fully explore viable solutions for the
    problem. It's tempting to want to implement the first solution that comes to
    mind. But creative exploration will be valuable here to find the best way to
    solve the problem. The purpose of this stage is to narrow down the possible
    solutions, understand and test their strengths and weaknesses, and then
    choose the best solution to implement in the final Build stage.

  <h4>Goals</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>
        Identify the strategy we will use to achieve our objectives.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Build a prototype that reflects what will be implemented.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What do we do in this step?</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>
      Exhaust all the potential solutions for what we build
      </p>
    </li>

        Refine ideas by quickly iterating and testing them out

    <li>
      <p>

  <h4>How do we do that?</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>
        Brainstorming exercises

      <p>
        Prototyping and user testing
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Build</h3>
  <p>
    Similar to the scientific method, we have a problem statement and a
    hypothesis to test if our understanding and solution is correct. The
    Build stage is where we manifest our hypothesis in order to test it and
    learn from it. We need to know if the solution is successful and how we might
    improve it. The two critical parts of this stage are: (1) to bring the
    solution to life through implementation and (2) to create a system for
    measuring the success of the solution.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

      <ul class="bulleted-list">

          <p>
            These are things that are not critical to the success of the
            project but have value and purpose at this stage. They usually need
            to be left out due to time constraints or technical limitations.

      </ul>

          <p>
            What you will build in this stage is based off of the prototype
            developed in the Explore stage.

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Continue to test and iterate to reach a polished version that is ready

    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure tracking is in place so we can learn about usage.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Establish the process for getting continual user feedback post-launch and
        how that feedback will be incorporated to quickly improve the product.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How do we do that?</h4>
  <ul class="bulleted-list">
    <li>
      <p>

  <h3>In conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In a way, I hate outlines like these. They make problem-solving seem
      deceptively easy or can make you feel like you're failing at the process
      if things are a bit messy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you don't see in an outline is the moving back and forth between
      stages, the many moments of self-doubt, the assumptions and risks you
      sometimes have to make to move forward, and all the times you end up
      being wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully what you <em>do</em> see here is an outline that makes
      problem-solving accessible. While it's not always easy, it is something
      that anyone can excel at if the time is taken to appreciate the process.
