  <p class="project-intro">
    The objective for this project was to increase the activation rate of our
    customers. To do this, I needed to empathize with the user's objective to
    get Segment working on their app as quickly as possible without friction.

  <h3>Brainstorming possible workflows</h3>
  <p>
    The primary goal is to help users get Segment set up on their app quickly
    with no errors. In addition, we want the user experience success, even if
    they don't get completely through the setup flow in one sitting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing we want is for the user to hit a roadblock, to feel that
    they've failed, or that they lack the technical knowledge to be successful
    with Segment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started by outlining where the user begins and where they want to end up.
    From there, I brainstormed as many workflows as possible to make sure we
    found the solution that helped users get to a place where they could
    experience success with the product as soon as possible.

  <h3>The end result</h3>
  <p>
    We created a final workflow that guides a user through a complicated set up
    with small wins at the completion of each step.

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    Referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a>
    as a guideline for the emotions users need to experience during the set up
    process, I learned a few things that are important for users in all kinds
    of interactions:
  </p>
  <h6>Experiencing feedback</h6>
  <p>
    Providing immediate feedback after users make decisions or advance forward
    in the flow communicates if their decisions will help them achieve the
    outcome they want and provide a sense of accomplishment.
  </p>
  <h6>Feeling Confident in one's ability</h6>
  <p>
   It's important that the user experiences a balance between the challenge of
   the difficulty of the taks and their technical ability to complete the task.
  </p>
  <h6>Eliminate distractions</h6>
  <p>
    If the user is in a state of flow, obstacles and challenges that come up
    outside of the immediate flow feel easier to overcome.
